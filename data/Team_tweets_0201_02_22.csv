Buffalo Sabres,2022-03-02 18:32:45+00:00,"@Huddy77792744 @LeafUnbiased @WatchMyReview I am not sure you get Power for Marner.

Not that Marner is not way better. But if Power agrees to play for Buffalo the Sabres would own the rights to him for 7 years.

The value difference of a potential elite level D for 7 yrs instead of a $10.9m winger for 3 yrs is massive."
